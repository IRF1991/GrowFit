## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.13+ (recommended) or 3.8+
- pip package manager

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/IRF1991/GrowFit.git
cd GrowFit

# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
./venv/Scripts/activate  # Windows
# source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install the package in development mode
pip install -e .

# Run the application
python growfit/app.py
```


## Data Storage

The application uses CSV files for data persistence:

### Dynamic Data (Active Configuration)
- **`user_profile.csv`**: User demographics and fitness experience levels
- **`routines.csv`**: Workout routine definitions and metadata  
- **`device_id.txt`**: Unique device identifier for user/testing distinction

### Historical Data (ML Training Data)
Files with `_data.csv` suffix collect historical records for machine learning model training:
- **`exercise_data.csv`**: Detailed exercise tracking and performance data
- **`session_data.csv`**: Workout session timestamps and completion status
- **`routines_data.csv`**: Routine execution history and statistics
- **`app_lifecycle_data.csv`**: App usage patterns and user retention analytics

## Development Setup

### INFORMACIÃ“N IMPORTANTE PARA DEVS

**The DataManager (located in `growfit/core/data_manager.py`) distinguishes between real users and testing users to preserve data integrity and facilitate developer testing.**

#### Purpose:
- Allow developers to have their own testing user version
- Prevent test data from interfering with real user data

#### How it works:
1. When running the app on a new device without `device_id.txt`, the console asks: **`Â¿Modo Testing? (y/N):`** to generate a unique ID
2. **"y"** generates a testing device_id with prefix `te_` (e.g., `te_7d95bb60`)
3. **Any other input** generates a normal user device_id with prefix `us_` (e.g., `us_a0d27a7a`)
4. **If the "Nueva Rutina" button is pressed**, a user device_id will be automatically generated

**The device_id is saved in `data/device_id.txt` to maintain it between sessions.**


#### User Types Summary:
- **Real Users**: Device ID prefix `us_` (e.g., `us_a0d27a7a`)
- **Testing Users**: Device ID prefix `te_` (e.g., `te_7d95bb60`)





## Branches

- **`main`**: Stable code
- **`testing`**: Development

## Roadmap

1. **Phase 1**: Core functionality (Exercise tracking, Timers) âœ…
2. **Phase 2**: Enhanced UI and routine management ðŸš§
3. **Phase 3**: Data analytics and basic recommendations
4. **Phase 4**: Machine learning integration
5. **Phase 5**: Mobile deployment and advanced features
